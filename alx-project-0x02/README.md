## Next.js Project Setup and Basics
This repository marks the beginning of the project where we learn how to set up a modern web application using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
Its purpose is to establish the initial project structure, document the setup steps, and prepare the environment for building reusable components, routing, API integration, and a clean project architecture.
